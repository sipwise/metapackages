      "message": "\u003e This seems wrong, we should add a versioned dependency here on the -pro one, otherwise we might end up pulling the carrier one which is not yet ready for pro?\n\nFor clarity, this means something like this?\n\n  ngcp-services-pro (\u003e\u003e 8.2.0.0) | ngcp-services-carrier,\n\nI didn\u0027t review in depth the other related changes, but it looks to me as if the dependency here it should continue to be only:\n\n  ngcp-services-pro,\n\nand then, if anything wants to be done to make the transition smoother, to have the packages like \"ngcp-$whatever-pro\" to have \"Provides: ngcp-$whatever-carrier\".\n\nI mean, I think that the most straightforward thing that we can do is -pro packages should take over -carrier ones by using \"Provides\".  But again, I defer to the opinion of those of you who have reviewed more in-depth.",
