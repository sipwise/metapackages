But again, I defer to the opinion of those of you who have reviewed more in-depth.",

      "message": "Sorry that I was unclear. What I mean is that all these «-pro | -carrier» deps seem wrong. They should be «-pro (\u003e\u003e first-version-after-the-merge)». The version can be completely skipped if we stop building the -carrier packages (no transitional dummy packages involved).\n\nOtherwise on an upgrade w/o transitional packages we will end up with -carrier disappearing (in the new release), so no upgrade for that one, but the version will keep being satisfied. With a transitional package, that might actually be fine, even though it keeps around a dependency on an unnecessary package.",
